# Online Meetup Lister

## Introduction

Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic we're all doing our duty and staying home.

But, we are all still hungry for knowledge and social interaction that
a meetup can provide.

Meetup.com is aware of this and has been encouraging communities to [host all events online][1],
it even provides help article to explain [how to host events online][2].

That said, meetup application still lacks the indexing features needed to
allow worlwide users to find events outside of their "vacinity (up to 100 miles)".

This is exactly my goal for writig this applications:

**writing a scraper of meetup.com to show all upcoming events up to max number of hours hours away (TZ) on given topic/s**
